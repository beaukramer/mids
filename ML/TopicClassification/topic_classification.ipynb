    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "1. Nearest neighbors deosn't work well for this problem because the dimensionality is so high that few texts are \"close\" to each other. In fact, the distance between texts may be similar so there is little ability to differentiate. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes in this case because the training size is small relative to the feature space. With such a small training size, Logistic Regression may be overfitting the training data. This is not the case for Naive Bayes. It has lower variance due to its simplicity (joint probability functions). This prevents it from overfitting the data as easily as Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There appears to be a positive linear realationship between C (the inverse of regularization strenght) and the sum of squares for each class. This makes sense as C is in the inverse of the regularization strength. So smaller values of C represent stronger regularization and we would expect models fitted with these to exhibit smaller sum of squares."

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001).\n",

    "ANSWER: \n",
    "* Tfidfvectorizer is different from countvectorizer in that countvectorizer weights all words equally. If a word is in the document, then the feature for that word receives a 1 for that document, otherwise it receives a 0. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency. Term Frequency counts the number of times a word appears in a document. Inverse Document Frequency takes the logarithm of the ratio of number of documents in corpus to number of documents in which the term appears. The closer this is to 1, the lower the weighting of the feature. The two, TF and IDF, are multiplied together and recorded in the feature space for a document. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is interesting that these texts are either very short or very long. The document length may have suggest something is amiss. The model also seems to be making the mistake of overweighting words that \"belong\" to another class. For example, in the first two documents various computer-related terms appear such as \"ftp\" or \"ASCII\" or \"RTF\". The word \"Mormon\", which should indicate that this is more likely to be alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, is receiving a lower weight than these tech terms becuase it occurs in more documents in the corpus. This is likely because two categories alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc may have many overlapping words. The tech terms by comparison may be more rare in the corpus so they receive a higher weight due to IDF. "
